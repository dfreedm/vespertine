# Vespertine

> A vespertine flower is one that blooms in the evening

Vespertine is a Chrome plugin which switches pages between light and dark mode.

It uses the Chrome Debugger's Emulation modes to switch the value for the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

When the icon is clicked, the page will switch to the opposite color scheme.
